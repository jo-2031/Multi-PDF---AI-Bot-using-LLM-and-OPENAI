# Multi-PDF---AI-Bot-using-LLM-and-OPENAI

## Introduction

I created an AI Chatbot that uses Langchain and a Language Model (LLM). It lets users upload PDFs and talk about them. The chatbot works on Streamlit and can understand what's in the uploaded PDFs. I used the OpenAI API for cost-effective features and Hugging Face for free uses to make the chatbot's responses better. The chatbot has interesting conversations with users and shares information from the PDFs. This project is written in Python and shows how advanced language technologies and APIs can work together smoothly. It's shows how Langchain, LLM, OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Streamlit can make a smart and interactive AI Chatbot.

## Dependencies and Installation

To install the MultiPDF Chat App, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Obtain an API key from OpenAI and add it to the `.env` file in the project directory.
```
LLM_OPENAI_API=your_secrit_api_key
LLM_Huggingface_api = Your secret key
```
Result and Output for the project
